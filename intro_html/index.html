<h1> Cat Facts</h1>
<p>Before they were our purring companions, cats were fierce hunters in the wild. The African wildcat, their closest ancestor, roamed deserts and savannas, perfecting the art of stealth and surprise. This adept predator had no need for human company, thriving independently.
Yet, its keen hunting skills and adaptability made it well-suited for environments where humans began storing surplus grain. As these wildcats ventured closer to human settlements, they found a new niche. Little did they know, their wild nature was the perfect foundation for what would become a domesticated life.</p

<P>Another amazing fact about cats is how they communicate and care for themselves. Cats use a combination of body language, vocal sounds, and scent marking to express their feelings and claim territory. A cat’s purr, often associated with happiness, can also occur when the cat is stressed or injured, as purring may help them calm down or heal. Additionally, cats spend a large portion of their day grooming, which helps regulate their body temperature, keep their fur clean, and reduce stress.</p>
