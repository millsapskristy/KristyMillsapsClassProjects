         Beloved Pets 

        </a>
</h2>
        <p>The first cats showed up more than 10 million years ago—long before humans—and honestly, that might explain their unshakable belief that they run the place. 
            Anyone who’s ever owned a cat knows the human–cat alliance was almost certainly the cat’s idea. 
            Sure, cats have a reputation for being aloof, dramatic, and completely self-sufficient, but despite the attitude, these fluffy little divas have been ruling homes (and hearts)
             around the world for thousands of years. They didn’t just adapt to living with humans—they trained us to serve them. 
             And judging by how willingly we obey, their plan worked perfectly. 
            From demanding food at 3 a.m. to claiming every sunny spot in the house, cats make the rules. We just live there.</p>

        Following a Human
    </a>
</h3>
        <p>Researchers haven’t been able to pinpoint exactly where domestic cats came from, but evidence suggests they evolved from wildcats about 12,000 years ago. 
            This happened around the same time humans started farming instead of hunting and gathering. 
            In 2004, archaeologists made an important discovery that helped explain early relationships between humans and cats. On the island of Cyprus, 
            French researchers found a grave where a human had been buried alongside a cat. 
            The grave is at least 9,500 years old, making it the earliest known evidence of a pet cat. 
            Since wildcats didn’t live on the island, researchers believe the cat must have traveled there with the human. 
            The way the cat was buried—close to and facing the person—suggests they shared a close bond.</p>

            <ul>
  <li>Cats meow mostly to communicate with humans.</li>
  <lI>Tail position, ear movement, and posture communicate mood.</lI>
  <lI>Scratching also serves as communication, leaving both visual marks and scent.</lI>
  <lI>Oxytocin is released in both cats and humans during moments of bonding, such as cuddling or playing.</lI>
