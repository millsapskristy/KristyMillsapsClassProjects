        <p>
            Cats display a wide range of behaviors that help them communicate and adapt to their environment. 
            One of the most common behaviors is meowing, which cats use mainly to interact with humans rather than other cats. 
            Body language is also important—tail position, ear movement, and posture can show whether a cat feels relaxed, curious, or threatened.
             Scratching is another natural behavior that helps cats keep their claws healthy while also marking territory through scent glands in their paws. 
            Cats often groom themselves to stay clean and reduce stress, and this behavior can also be a sign of comfort. 
            Together, these behaviors help cats express their needs and maintain their physical and emotional well-being.

            In addition to communication and grooming behaviors, cats are known for their strong instincts and daily routines. 
            Many cats are most active during dawn and dusk, a behavior known as being crepuscular, which comes from their history as hunters. 
            Play behavior, such as chasing or pouncing, helps cats practice hunting skills and burn off energy, even in a home environment. 
            Cats also value their independence and personal space, often choosing when and how they interact with people. 
            At the same time, many cats form close bonds with their owners and may show affection by purring, rubbing against them, or following them from room to room. 
            These behaviors reflect a balance between a cat’s wild instincts and its role as a companion animal.
