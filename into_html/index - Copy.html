<h1> Cat Facts</h1>
<p1>Cats are fascinating animals with a long history of living alongside humans. One interesting fact is that cats were domesticated over 9,000 years ago, likely because they helped control rodents around early farming communities. Unlike dogs, cats largely domesticated themselves, choosing to live near humans while keeping much of their independent nature. Cats also have excellent senses: their hearing is far more sensitive than a human’s, and their night vision allows them to see in very low light, making them skilled hunters even in the dark.

<P2>Another amazing fact about cats is how they communicate and care for themselves. Cats use a combination of body language, vocal sounds, and scent marking to express their feelings and claim territory. A cat’s purr, often associated with happiness, can also occur when the cat is stressed or injured, as purring may help them calm down or heal. Additionally, cats spend a large portion of their day grooming, which helps regulate their body temperature, keep their fur clean, and reduce stress.</p2>
