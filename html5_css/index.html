     Beloved Pets 
    </a>
</h2>
        <p>The first felines existed more than 10 million years ago, predating humans by millions of years. 
            Perhaps the fact that cats were here first explains why they’re so comfortable acting like they own the place. 
            It also won’t be a surprise to anyone who’s had a pet kitty to hear that the alliance between human and cat was probably the cat’s idea. 
            Cats may have a reputation as aloof and self-sufficient divas, 
            but these fluffy felines have been beloved pets in homes around the world for millennia. </p>

        Following a Human

</h3>
        <p>Researchers have found it challenging to determine the exact origins of the domestic cat, but evidence suggests cats evolved from wildcats about 12,000 years ago. 
            This development coincided with humans shifting to an agricultural way of life. 
            A major archaeological discovery in 2004 provided important insight into early human–cat relationships. 
            French archaeologists unc	overed a human buried alongside a cat in a grave on the island of Cyprus. 
            The grave dates back at least 9,500 years, making it the earliest known evidence of a pet cat. 
            Because wildcats were not native to Cyprus, researchers concluded the cat must have traveled there with the human. 
            The cat’s burial position, close to and facing the human, suggests a strong bond between them.</p>

  <li>Cats meow mostly to communicate with humans.</li>
  <lI>Tail position, ear movement, and posture communicate mood.</lI>
  <lI>Scratching also serves as communication, leaving both visual marks and scent.</lI>
  <lI>Oxytocin is released in both cats and humans during moments of bonding, such as cuddling or playing.</lI>
